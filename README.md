## Project Vision
The project aims to promote collaboration and innovation among researchers by providing a transparent and decentralized platform for managing research contributions and distributing rewards. By utilizing blockchain technology, this system ensures that rewards are allocated fairly and securely without relying on centralized intermediaries.

## Key Features

- **Ownership and Access Control**:
  - Only the contract owner can add researchers and distribute rewards.
  - Researchers must be registered by the owner to participate.

- **Reward Management**:
  - Add funds to a central reward pool.
  - Distribute rewards directly to registered researchers based on their contributions.

- **Transparency**:
  - Events are emitted for every significant action (e.g., researcher addition, fund distribution), ensuring transparency and traceability.

- **Data Retrieval**:
  - Fetch researcher details such as name and total rewards earned.
  - Check the current balance of the contract.

- **Secure Ether Transfers**:
  - Ether is transferred securely to researchers upon reward distribution.
